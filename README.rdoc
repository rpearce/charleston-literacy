== How to get set up:
    git clone git@github.com:rpearce/charleston-literacy.git
    cd charleston-literacy
    bundle install
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    rails server

This will get the app set up locally; however, you will not have most of the images, content, etc.

== Accessing Admin Area
Go to {localhost:3000/refinery}[http://localhost:3000/refinery] to create a super user and gain access to the admin area.
